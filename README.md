## Systemd Service:
For production deployment, use the included systemd service file:
1. Copy `dadbot.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`
2. Update the token in the service file or use systemd environment files
3. `sudo systemctl enable dadbot && sudo systemctl start dadbot`

## Features:
- **Structured Logging**: JSON output for systemd/Elastic ingestion
- **Metrics Tracking**: Event logging with metrics for dashboards
- **Environment Config**: Supports both CLI flags and environment variables

## Note:
I haven't tested this on Windows. Should work on all *.nix platforms. We push to prod without testing here ðŸŽ‰
